# Broadcom PCI/PCIe SDK

[![Build Status](https://www.travis-ci.com/xiallc/broadcom_pci_pcie_sdk.svg?branch=master)](https://www.travis-ci.com/xiallc/broadcom_pci_pcie_sdk)

XIA LLC develops a number of products using the PLX 9054 chipset. We maintain this repository as a
way to provide CI support for our software. From time to time we may need to restructure this
repository to meet the current needs of our internal processes.

For the most part, we will stick with the vanilla Broadcom releases. Since we're a small team, we
cannot support every combination of OS, kernel, compiler that may be encountered in the wild. If you
run into issues we'll do our best to help, but may recommend that you contact Broadcom's support.

Users can obtain the original source code directly
from [Broadcom](https://www.broadcom.com/products/pcie-switches-bridges/software-dev-kits).
